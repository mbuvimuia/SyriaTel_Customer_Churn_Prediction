    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "SyriaTel is a telecommunications company providing mobile services to customers across Syria. In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer retention is crucial for maintaining revenue and growth. Churn, refers to customers leaving the service thus poses a significant threat to the company's profitability and market share. Predicting customer churn allows SyriaTel to proactively address factors leading to customer dissatisfaction and implement strategies to retain valuable customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "1. High Competition: The telecom industry is saturated with multiple service providers, offering similar services at competitive prices making it easy for customers to switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Customer Behavior Analysis: Understanding the diverse needs and behaviors of customers to identify those at risk of churning.\n",
    "3. Data Quality: Ensuring the data used for analysis is accurate, complete, and up-to-date to build reliable predictive models.\n",
    "4. Resource Allocation: Allocating resources effectively to retain customers at risk of churning while minimizing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "SyriaTel wants to predict customer churn based on historical data to identify customers at risk of leaving the service. By accurately predicting churn, SyriaTel can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and improve overall customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. To gather and pre-process customer data to ensure quality and completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To identify and create relevant features that can contribute to customer churn.\n",
    "3. To build and train various machine learning model to predict churn.\n",
    "4. To asses the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Solution\n",
    "The proposed solution involves building a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning based on historical data. By accurately predicting churn, SyriaTel can:\n",
    " - Target at-risk customers with personalized retention strategies.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Optimize marketing and promotional efforts.\n",
    " - Improve overall customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics of the Model\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of the churn prediction model, the following metrics will be used:\n",
    "1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances(both churn and non-churn) out of the total instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precision**: The proportion of correctly predicted churn instances out of all instances predicted as churn.\n",
    "3. **Recall**: The proportion of correctly predicted churn instances out of all actual churn instances.\n",
    "4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "By leveraging machine learning to predict customer churn, SyriaTel can gain valuable insights into customer behavior and proactively address churn risks. This approach not only helps in retaining customers but also enhances the overall customer experience and strengthens the company's competitive position in the telecom industry."
